# How to use

Either download one of the prebuilt .exe files or build your own .exe file from the source .ahk files.
You probably want to place the .exe file in your startup folder on windows so it runs automatically after turning on your PC.

# How to run .ahk files

Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
Download one of the .ahk files, double click it to run it.

# How to build your own .exe file from source

Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
Walk throught the steps in the GUI and use MSPRESS for compression.
Pick AHK v1 Unicode 64Bit or AHK v2 U64 as a base. Perhaps you want to pick an .ico file too (that's the icon of the .exe file).
